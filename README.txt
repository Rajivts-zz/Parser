This Application has been developed as a part of a MOOC at Udacity. It can be used to parse and check whether certain inputs fit a particular context free grammar.

Input:

grammar: Defined as a list of tuples
tokens: Defined as a list, which represents the input and each element of the list is a token produced by a lexer.

Output:

result: Boolean value representing whether the input fits the specified grammar or not.

The application is developed in Python 2.7 and all operating systems compatible.
